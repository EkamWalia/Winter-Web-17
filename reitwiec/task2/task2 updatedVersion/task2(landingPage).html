					<img src=https://i.giphy.com/media/w5M9QgelugIJG/giphy.webp ></div><p1 class="para" style="padding-top: 30px" >Rachel is a very complicated character, but she can be described as an ESFP. She gets her energy from interacting with her friends because she doesn’t like to be on her own. 
					She cares about trends and her appearance in the minds of others, which leads her to be constantly aware of her surroundings. She works in the fashion industry so it’s only natural for her to act this way. Rachel thinks with her heart, which, like Ross, means that she easily gets hurt when it comes to relationships. She cares deeply for her friends and pays attention to their emotions. </p1>

					<img src=https://media.giphy.com/media/aWPGuTlDqq2yc/giphy.gif></div><p1 class="para" style="padding-top: 30px;" >Joey can be described by his personality label of ENFP. He could not be a more extroverted individual. He constantly thrusts himself into new social situations because of his occupation as an actor. He is very comfortable with talking to others, even though what he says may not make any sense. This is probably due his tendency to prefer abstract and theoretical way of processing information. </p1>

					<img src=https://media.giphy.com/media/l6Ai3DTtWy47e/giphy.gif></div><p1 class="para" style="padding-top: 30px" >Monica definitely draws her energy from others and her constant desire to control and manage her friends’ actions. Rachel even puts her in charge of her love life, which Monica happily takes on because of her personal belief that she knows more about Rachel than Rachel herself does. Details define everything for Monica, and this causes her to make most of her decisions with her head through logic and reason. As a head chef, she is very in control and detail-oriented. More than anything, Monica thrives on order and schedules; you will never see the apartment out of order or dirty while she is there.</p1>

					<h1>Chandler Bing</h1><div class="imgs2">
					<img src=https://media.giphy.com/media/epmFtnZVgqoV2/giphy.gif></div><p1 class="para" style="padding-top: 30px" >Chandler is quite outspoken with his quick, sarcastic quips as he constantly jokes around and pokes fun of his friends. He always seems to have some unusual ideas brewing in his mind that stem from external factors and he likes to focus on what the future holds, choosing to avoid his past and family life. Chandler is smart (he works for a large corporation doing statistical analysis and data reconfiguration, whatever that is) so he tends to make decisions based on logic or reason. </p1>

					<img src=https://media.giphy.com/media/QdPNdgj81NaDu/giphy.gif></div><p1 class="para" style="padding-top: 30px" >Phoebe is one of those people who could talk to anyone about anything. She gets her energy through talking and singing about the abstract ideas and theories she comes up with. Her imagination is incredible- just listen to any one of her songs or take a trip in her own doll house she created out of shoe boxes complete with a slide, a licorice room, an aroma room and a bubble machine. Like Chandler, she is very spontaneous in all aspects of her lifestyle </p1>

					<h1>Ross Geller</h1><div class="imgs2">
					<img src=https://media.giphy.com/media/FY56lXEc3KY9y/giphy.gif></div><p1 class="para" style="padding-top: 30px" >Ross is the only introverted character, Ross is somewhat shy and keeps to himself- especially during his college years when interacting with Rachel, his secret crush. He is thorough and remembers specifics about certain individuals because he values loyalty. He tends to make decisions with his heart, which leads to emotional pain and heartache most of the time.Ross is highly agreeable, as demonstrated by his compassion, trust and generosity. He is very willing to compromise his own personal interests for those of others. In fact, Monica sometimes criticizes him for being their parents’ favorite child because he always tried to please them with his highly agreeable tendencies.</p1>
